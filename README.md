# Fuzzy-Logic-velocity-control
Fuzzy Logic is used to control velocity for a two wheel drive. Microcontroller(pic16f877a) is used to genrate PWM and
to count the number of pulses from encoder.
Communication between microcntroller and computer is done through UART.
The Fuzzy logic application is carried out in QT IDE.
The generated value is sent to microcontroller(pic16f877a).
The microcontroller generates necessary PWM for two wheel drive.
